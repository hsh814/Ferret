;
; Posadisrc - Configuration file for Posadis
;
; For help, consult the manual shipped with Posadis, or have a look at the
; Posadisrc(5) manual page ("man posadisrc").
;

; -------------------------- General Configuration --------------------------

; Listen - this setting determines on what IP numbers and/or ports to listen.
;
; Normally, you can just use the default "listen any" line to listen to port
; 53 for all network interfaces, but if you run a multi-homed host, or if you
; only want to listen to a specific network interface. If you only want to
; listen to tcp or udp, prefix the IP address by "tcp/" or "udp/".
;
; NOTE: If you have Microsoft Internet Connection Sharing, you'll want to
; listen to your internet-visible IP number only, because ICS has its own
; DNS server for internal networks that (despite of what its documentation
; says) cannot be disabled.

listen any                      ; listen on any network interface
;listen 3000                     ; listen to port 3000 on any network interface
;listen 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.100 ; only listen to local network interfaces
;listen udp/212.142.28.66        ; only listen to UDP on internet interface

; Logfile - file to log to
;
; This file will be used to send log messages to. Since Posadis for Unix
; will also log to syslog, you will probably not need this (default is no log
; file for Unix).

logfile /var/posadis/posadis.log

; Do_query_logging - enable/disable query logging
;
; Determines whether to enable query logging. If set to true, Posadis will log
; each query to the usual channels. Note that you can temporarily enable
; logging even if this is set to false (which is the default setting) by
; sending a signal to the Posadis process (Unix only). See the manual for
; more details.

;do_query_logging true

; User/Group (Unix only) - run unprivileged
;
; To reduce security risks when Posadis is exploited remotely, you can make
; Posadis drop privileges after binding to the sockets. Note that data files
; should be readable by this user as well as root.

;user dns
;group dns

; Max_threads, Max_tcp_connections, Tcp_priority, Max_cache_items,
; Resolv_patience - resource limitations
;
; These options set limits to the resources Posadis can use. For detailed
; information, refer to the manual. The defaults are usually reasonable.

;max_threads 50         ; no more than 50 simultaneous threads
;max_tcp_connections -1 ; this means no limit
;tcp_priority 192.168.* ; always allow TCP connections from this network
;max_cache_items 1000   ; max 1000 domain names in cache
;resolv_patience 15     ; max number of steps in resolving lookups

; ------------------------------- Cache setup -------------------------------

; Cache-ns: list of root nameservers
;
; This is the list of root nameservers Posadis uses initially. Note that even
; if you don't want to have a caching nameserver or if you use forwarders, you
; still need this! You can generally just keep this, or use the
; posadis-getroots tool to get an updated or alternate list.

cache-ns .
  A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@198.41.0.4
  B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@128.9.0.107
  C.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@192.33.4.12
  D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@128.8.10.90
  E.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@192.203.230.10
  F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@192.5.5.241
  G.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@192.112.36.4
  H.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@128.63.2.53
  I.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@192.36.148.17
  J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@192.58.128.30
  K.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@193.0.14.129
  L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@198.32.64.12
  M.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.@202.12.27.33

; Initial_Cache_File: loading of initial cache data
;
; Loads initial cache data from the given master file, for example to blacklist
; certain domain names.

;initial_cache_file blacklist.cache
       
; Cache-forward: forwarding of DNS queries
;
; Instead of doing everything by itself, Posadis can also let the DNS server
; of your provider do the dirty work, while still caching the results of the
; lookups to gain even more speed. This is a good choice if your ISP has a
; well-reachable DNS server.

;cache-forward .
;  1.2.3.4             ; ISP primary DNS server
;  5.6.7.8             ; ISP primary DNS server
;  1dea:332::dead:beef ; the ISP also does IPv6

; Allow_recursion - Whom to allow recursion to
;
; If given, only hosts in this list are allowed recursion. Because recursion
; can consume quite some resources, you should usually limit this to just
; your local network. Default is to allow recursion to anybody.

;allow_recursion 192.168.* ; just the local network
;allow_recursion none      ; no-one!

; Refuse_recursion - Whom to  refuse recursion to
;
; Anyone in this list will be refused recursion, whether or not the person is
; in the allow list doesn't matter.

;refuse_recursion any          ; disable recursion altogether
                               ; (same as allow_recursion none)
;refuse_recursion 192.168.1.17 ; this pc is not allowed to do recursion

; Cache_statistics - Display statistics about cache
;
; If this is set to true, Posadis will periodically (that is, every 60
; seconds) display statics about the cache: the number of domain names
; and records stored, and the number of cache hits/misses. Defaults to false.

;cache_statistics true ; display cache statistics

; ----------------------------- Loading modules -----------------------------

; LibDir - Directory for loadable modules
;
; This is the directory Posadis will look in for loadable modules. You can
; specify as many directories as you want.

;libdir /usr/lib/posadis, /opt/posfile/lib

; LoadModule - Load a Posadis module
;
; This statement loads a Posadis module. Modules can add custom behavior to
; Posadis such as definining new zone types and configuration settings. Refer
; to the documentation for the module to see how to use it;

; Load the Localhost module, which is a core part of Posadis. This module
; defines the 'localhost' zone type. See the reference for more information.
;loadmodule "localhost"

; Load the revmap module, also included in Posadis. This module defines the
; 'revmap' and 'formap' zone types. See the reference for more information.
;loadmodule "revmap"

; -------------------------- Zone and Master files --------------------------

; Configdir - Configuration directory
;
; This is the directory Posadis will look in for zone and master files.

configdir /etc/posadis/

; Datadir - Data directory
;
; Required as temporary storage for both serving and retrieving zone transfers

datadir /var/posadis/

; Now is the time to add zone and master files to the Posadis configuration.
; There are basically three different ways of doing this:
;
;   1) Use the "monitor" module. This module automagically loads all zone files
;      in your configuration directory, and re-loads them when you change them,
;      so your changes are reflected directly. To do this, add a
;      "LoadModule monitor" statement to your Posadisrc. Note: if you run a
;      Unix operating system, you will need to have the "FAM" software package
;      installed. If you install Posadis from binary packages, you will also
;      need to install the "Posadis-monitor" package.
;
;   2) Use zone files. For primary zones, you can create standard DNS master
;      files, for example using the Posadis Master File Editor, and for other
;      zones, you can create zone files in which you specify configuration
;      settings for the zone. Posadis comes with some examples, and you can
;      read more information in the Posadis manual. Use the 'ZoneFile' and/or
;      'All_Zone_Files' configuration settings. These zone files will be
;      re-loaded according to the 'Zone_Update_TTL' statement.
;
;   3) Use the 'zone' statement. If you don't want zone files hanging around,
;      you can also embed them into the Posadisrc.

;LoadModule monitor ; Load the monitoring module

; ZoneFile  - Load a zone file into Posadis
;
; This statement loads a zone file from the Posadis configuration directory
; into Posadis. Zone file names (for non-primary zones) should be of the format
; zn.<domainname> or <domainname>.znf. Zone master file names (for primary
; zones) should be of the format db.<domainname> or <domainname>.prm.

;ZoneFile "zn.acdam.net", "db.acdam.com" ; load acdam zones
ZoneFile "db.campus.edu"

; All_Zone_Files - Load all zone files
;
; If set to true, this statement will load all available zone files and master
; files in the Posadis configuration directory.

;all_zone_files true

; Update_TTL - Automatically re-load configuration files
;
; This determines the interval after which the zone files loaded using
; 'ZoneFile' or 'All_Zone_Files' will be checked for changes.

;update_ttl 10m ; after ten minutes

; Zone - Add a zone
;
; Zone is the basic statement you can use to add zones to your Posadis
; configuration. It has the syntax zone <type> <domain>, where <type> is the
; zone type. Posadis has built-in 'primary' and 'secondary' zone types.
; After the zone statement, you can specify configuration settings for the
; zone, which should be indented by at least one space to distinguish them
; from common configuration settings. For more information, refer to the
; Posadis manual.

;zone primary acdam.net ; create a primary zone for acdam.net
;  file db.acdam.net    ; the master file is db.acdam.net in the config dir
;  update_ttl 10m       ; re-load it every ten minutes

;zone secondary acdam.com             ; create a secondary zone for acdam.com
;  masters 216.31.32.11, 216.31.32.13 ; these are the master DNS servers

;zone localhost localhost.acdam.net ; this zone type is defined by the
;                                   ; localhost module

;zone revmap .192.168.*                ; zone type from 'revmap' module
;  prefix dyn.acdam.net
;  nslist ns1.acdam.net, ns2.acdam.net

;zone formap dyn.acdam.net             ; from 'revmap' module as well
;  nslist ns1.acdam.net, ns2.acdam.net
